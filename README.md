# This is my Portfolio 
[Link to Portfolio](https://kbentley8.github.io/portfolio/)
   <p> In this project, I was tasked with creating a portofolio website that contains an about me page, photo of me, a link to my current work, and a list of ways to get in contact with me. I used html, css, and javascript to complete this homework.
